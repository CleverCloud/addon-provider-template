Addon API template/example for Clever Cloud addon providers
===========================================================

This project is a template for Addon API written in scala with Play!
Framework 2.

This project can look a little complex because of the extra traits,
but it's meant to be re-usable.  So you will find traits to implement
in the utils package.

You should not have to modify the Application.scala class apart from
making it extend your Persistence and ProvisionDriver implementations.

The entities.scala file contains the basic case class you will need to
work as an addon. Please read the comments of the class to get more
informations.
